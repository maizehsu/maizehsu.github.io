{"posts":[{"title":"Linux setup for Virtual Box","text":"How to install Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on VirtualBox1. Downloading Ubuntu image Open the Ubuntu website. Go to the official website https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop. You can download the Ubuntu disk image (also known as an ISO file) here. The recommended version is Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS. 2. Install VirtualBox Download VirtualBox. Go to https://www.virtualbox.org/. The tutorial to install VirtualBox for both Windows and Mac is here https://www.wikihow.com/Install-VirtualBox 3. Create a Virtual Machine Click “New”. Click the blue badge in the upper-left corner of the VirtualBox window, which opens a pop-up menu. Enter a name for your virtual machine. Type whatever you want to name your virtual machine (e.g. ,Ubuntu) into the “Name” field. Select Linux as the “Type” value. Expand the “Type” drop-down menu and select Linux. Select Ubuntu as the “Version” value. Make sure Ubuntu (64-bit) is selected in the “Version” drop-down menu. Click “Next”. Select an amount of RAM to use. Drag the slider left or right to decrease or increase the amount of RAM that VirtualBox will have available for your Ubuntu virtual machine. The ideal amount of RAM is automatically selected when you get to this page. Make sure not to increase the RAM into the red region; keep the slider in the green region. Choose the File location and File size. We will be setting the disk type to VDI and the file size to be 40GB. It depends on the free space on your disk. You may apply the default settings. 4. Install Ubuntu in VirtualBox Double click the virtual machine “Ubuntu” and select your Ubuntu ISO. Click “Open”, then “Start”, then “Install Ubuntu”. Check both boxes on the “Preparing to install Ubuntu” page then “Continue”. This will ensure that everything Ubuntu needs to run will be installed. Check the “Erase disk and install Ubuntu” box then “Install Now”. This may sound scary, but don’t worry—nothing on your computer will be erased. Click Continue when prompted. This confirms that you understand the virtual machine’s virtual drive will be “erased” (there’s nothing on it anyway) and begins the Ubuntu installation process. 5. Setting up Ubuntu Select a time zone then “Continue”. Click a section that correlates with your position on the map. You may choose “Shanghai”. Enter your username, computer’s name and password. Wait for Ubuntu to finish installing. This process may take anywhere from a couple of minutes to half an hour depending on the performance of your computer. Restart the virtual machine and log in. Remember your password. Special thanks to VE280 SU2019 TA Group for this part of instruction Things to do after installation of Ubuntu1. Change apt source https://www.jianshu.com/p/5400722c369c https://mirror.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/ubuntu/ To edit source.list use command sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list For vi/vim related commands go to https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/69357225 Pay attention to Linux edition 2. Update the system sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade 3. ssh setup check ssh service: ps -e | grep ssh if not installed: sudo apt install openssh-client openssh-server sudo service ssh restart ssh-keygen add the public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_ keys (note: user-specific) (note: use ifconfig -a to check the local ip address) 4. Essential packages sudo apt install build-essential net-tools cmake git 5. Link your GitHub repo to your virtual computer!6. For other essential apps sudo snap install &lt;name&gt; 7. Set full screen and definitionInstall guest additions sudo mkdir --p /media/cdrom sudo mount -t auto /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom/ cd /media/cdrom/ sudo sh VBoxLinuxAdditions.run Set screen definition xrandr -s 1920x1440 Also applicable to Ubuntu on other virtual devices (etc. VMware, docker) 8.
